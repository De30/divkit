# DIVKIT

**DivKit** üêã is an open source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework.
SDUI is a an emerging technique that leverage the server to build the user interfaces of their mobile apps.

DivKit is a good choice to start using the Server-Driven UI in your project because it can be easily integrated as a simple view in any place of your app. At the start point, you do not need  a server integration. You can include all JSON on the client-side to try it in a real world application.

We‚Äôve made a sandbox for you to experiment with. The DivKit Web engine is connected to it, but you can also download iOS/Android app demos from stores and link them to the sandbox. The data will be updated live: the sandbox connects to the playground app via web sockets.
